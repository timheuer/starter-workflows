# This workflow will build and push a .NET Framework application to an Azure Web App on every push to the master branch.
#
# To configure this workflow:
#
# 1. Set up a secret in your repository named AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE with the value of your Azure publish profile.
#    Get the publish profile from the portal: https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/deployment/tutorial-import-publish-settings-azure?view=vs-2019#create-the-publish-settings-file-in-azure-app-service
#
# 2. Change the values for the AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME and AZURE_WEBAPP_PACKAGE_PATH environment variables  (below).
